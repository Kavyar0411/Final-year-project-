# Heart Attack Risk Prediction using Retinal Images

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting the risk of heart attack using **retinal fundus images**. Retinal blood vessels reflect cardiovascular health, making retinal imaging a **non-invasive and effective method** for early heart disease risk assessment.

The system uses **image preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning techniques** to classify patients as **Normal** or **High Risk**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze retinal images for cardiovascular indicators
- Extract meaningful vascular features
- Predict heart attack risk using machine learning models
- Provide early risk assessment support
