# Heart Attack Risk Prediction using Retinal Images
* Project Overview

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including heart attacks, are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in preventing severe outcomes.

This project focuses on predicting heart attack risk using retinal fundus images by leveraging image processing and machine learning techniques. Retinal images provide a non-invasive way to analyze blood vessel patterns, which are closely related to cardiovascular health.
